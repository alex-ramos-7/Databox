This repository holds the HTML, CSS, and images for the Azure Data Box partner web page. Please read this entire README before reviewing the code, and feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or concerns you may have.

The HTML for the page can be found in the *Data Box regular.html* file. The CSS for the page is found in the *core.css* file in the *Azure Data Box_Microsoft Azure_file* folder. That folder also contains a sub-folder titled *partnerLogos* that holds the PNG logos used in the page.



In order to view the web page, you'll need to either **clone** or **download** the *entire* repository and open up the *Data Box regular.html*
