### Note to code reviewers

This repository holds the HTML, CSS, and images for the Azure Data Box partner web page. Please read this entire README before reviewing the code.

In order to view the web page, you'll need to either *clone* or *download* the **entire** repository and open up the **Data Box regular.html** file in a browser window. 

There are multiple files where we've written code for the site;
* **Data Box regular.html** holds the raw HTML for the site 
* **core.css**, found in the **Azure Data Box_Microsoft Azure_file** folder is the stylesheet for the page
* The folder titled **partnerLogos**, also found in the **Azure Data Box_Microsoft Azure_file** folder, holds the logos used in the page.

To ease the review process and make it easier to find the code I contributed, Iâ€™ve added comments where the new code begins and ends in both the HTML and CSS documents. 
* **Data Box regular.html**:the new code lies between lines 2170-2347. 
* **core.css**: the new code starts at line 18761 and continues until the end of the document.
