### Note to code reviewers

This repository holds the HTML, CSS, and images for the Azure Data Box partner web page. Please read this entire README before reviewing the code.

The HTML for the page can be found in the **Data Box regular.html** file. The CSS for the page is found in the **core.css** file in the **Azure Data Box_Microsoft Azure_file** folder. That folder also contains a sub-folder titled **partnerLogos** that holds the PNG logos used in the page.

To ease the review process and make it easier to find the code I contributed, I’ve added comments where the new code begins and ends in both the HTML and CSS documents. In **Data Box regular.html**, the new code lies between lines 2170-2312. In **core.css*, the new code starts at line 18761 and continues until the end of the document. 

In order to view the web page, you'll need to either *clone* or *download* the **entire** repository and open up the **Data Box regular.html** file in a browser window.
